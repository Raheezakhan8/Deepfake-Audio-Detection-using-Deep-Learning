Summary

Deepfake audio uses AI to manipulate speech signals in ways that are hard to detect using traditional methods. This work proposes a deep learning-based detection approach with a focus on feature extraction and neural network modeling.

Methodology (High-level)
1. Input audio (WAV)
2. Data preprocessing
3. Feature extraction (e.g., spectrogram-based features)
4. Model-based classification: Fake vs Real
5. Evaluation using standard classification metrics

Notes on Data Availability
The original dataset used during the UG project is currently available for redistribution.
